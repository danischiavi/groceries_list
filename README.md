# groceries_list
On a fast-paced world, nutrition is becoming less and less of a priority, letting high-processed food to become the new norm. I truly believe that a home-made meal cooked from scratch is the healthiest, regardless of the type of the diet. As Michael Pollan would say: 
> _Eat anything you want. Just cook it yourself._ 

Sometimes preparing a meal can be overwhelming, but this code will help you to tackle one of the most difficult daily questions: 

***"what are we having for dinner?"*** :fearful:


Just follow this 3 easy steps:

:heavy_check_mark: Once a week, open and run the groceries_list code. Choose 7 dinners among the list, type "end" and copy the generated list in a notepad which can be displayed on your phone :spiral_notepad:

:heavy_check_mark: Go to the supermarket and buy what is on the list :shopping_cart:

:heavy_check_mark: Every day, when dinner-time arrives, check your list of meals for that week and choose what you fancy. All the ingredients will be in your kitchen :muscle:

This code is a great tool to plan ahead for the week in a few minutes and save SO much useful time! 

The key features are: 

  * **Customised list of meals:**  “meals.json” file stores meals:ingredients as nested-dictionary key:value pairs. This file can be modified and customised using a text editor. 

* **Highlighting of season-vegetables:** “seasonal.json” file stores vegetables organised by season (southern hemisphere). Applying nested iteration and conditional statements, the code search for meals, whose names contain season-vegetables and change them to uppercase. The season is define by the current month. This files can be modified easily using a text editor. 
 
* **Meals associated to the ingredients:** applying nested iteration and conditional statements, the code creates a dictionary with ingredient:amount as key:value pair adding the amount on each meal for a specific ingredient. This dictionary is returned at the end. 


This amazing features will save you time, energy and money. You will be able to make an environmentally-friendly choice without spending hours and hours looking into new receipts every week, which can be very time-consuming and discouraging. You don't even have to think what and how much do you need- just choose the meals and the code will tell you. And when you have time and feel creative, you can always try new ideas and add them to the list! 

But the best of all, you will have the great and healthy habit of cooking a fresh meal for you and love ones:smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
